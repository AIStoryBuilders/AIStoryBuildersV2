## A Project of [AIStoryBuilders](https://github.com/AIStoryBuilders)

* [AIStoryBuilders](https://github.com/AIStoryBuilders/AIStoryBuilders): V1, the original Windows app. V2's
  Windows app reads and writes its story files unchanged.
* [AIStoryBuildersOnline](https://github.com/AIStoryBuilders/AIStoryBuildersOnline): the V1 browser version. V2's
  browser app has replaced it at [online.aistorybuilders.com](https://online.aistorybuilders.com/)
* [AIOrchestrator](https://github.com/AIStoryBuilders/AIOrchestrator)

## About V2

AI StoryBuilders V2 on **.NET 11** (release candidate): a **Windows MAUI Blazor Hybrid** app and a
server-less **Blazor WebAssembly** app that share one Razor class library. The structure follows
[KnowledgeGraphBuilder](https://github.com/ADefWebserver/KnowledgeGraphBuilder). Aspire is used
only at development time to launch both apps.

The implementation plan is [Docs/AIStoryBuildersV2-Plan.md](Docs/AIStoryBuildersV2-Plan.md), and
the rules for contributors and agents are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Projects

| Project | Kind | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `AIStoryBuildersV2` | MAUI (`net11.0-windows10.0.19041.0`) | Desktop shell; hosts the Blazor UI in a `BlazorWebView` |
| `AIStoryBuildersV2.Web` | Blazor WebAssembly (`net11.0`) | Browser app (static files only); hosts the same UI |
| `AIStoryBuildersV2.Shared` | Razor class library | **All shared UI and app logic lives here** |
| `AIStoryBuildersV2.AppHost` | Aspire AppHost | Dev-time only: launches the Windows app and the WASM dev server |
| `AIStoryBuildersV2.ServiceDefaults` | Aspire shared | Kept in the solution, referenced by nothing |
| `AIStoryBuildersV2.Tests` | xUnit | Tests |

The Android, iOS and Mac Catalyst targets are opt-in: pass `-p:IncludeMobileTargets=true`
(iOS and Mac Catalyst need macOS). Only Windows is a supported target.

## Build and test

Requires the .NET SDK `11.0.100-rc.3` (pinned in `global.json`) and the `maui-windows` workload.
See [Docs/Dev-Environment.md](Docs/Dev-Environment.md).

```bash
dotnet build AIStoryBuildersV2/AIStoryBuildersV2.csproj -f net11.0-windows10.0.19041.0
```

```bash
dotnet build AIStoryBuildersV2.Web/AIStoryBuildersV2.Web.csproj
```

```bash
dotnet test AIStoryBuildersV2.Tests/AIStoryBuildersV2.Tests.csproj
```

Run the web app with `dotnet run --project AIStoryBuildersV2.Web`, or run both apps with
`aspire run` from the repository root.

## Data structure

V2 uses the same story data as V1 ([Docs/V1-File-Format.md](Docs/V1-File-Format.md)), plus an optional Knowledge
Base per story.

## Where your stories live

| App | Location |
|-----|----------|
| Windows (MAUI) | `Documents\AIStoryBuilders`, the same folder and file format as AI StoryBuilders V1. Settings are in the app's preferences; the API key is in Windows SecureStorage. |
| Browser (WASM) | This browser's `localStorage`: one zipped story per key (`asb2:story:{Title}`), plus `asb2:stories`, `asb2:settings` and `asb2:log`. |

Each story can have a **Knowledge Base**: Markdown pages in `{Title}/KnowledgeBase/`. The folder is created only
when the first page is added, so V1 never sees a change to stories that have none, and it travels with the story
in `.stybld` exports.

### Using V1 and V2 together (Windows)

V2 reads and writes V1's story files unchanged, so both apps can open the same stories. **Run one app at a time:**
if both edit the same story at once, the last save wins. V2 never reads or changes V1's
`AIStoryBuildersSettings.config` or `ModelCache\`; that file may still hold a V1 API key in plain text.

### Browser storage

- Browser storage is small (often about 5 MB per site). When it is full, the workspace shows a banner, your
  latest changes stay in the tab, and **Export Project** (Details tab) saves a `.stybld` copy.
- **Clearing this site's data deletes your stories.** Export the ones you want to keep.
- The API key is stored in plain text in this browser and is sent only to the chosen provider. Use a key with a
  spending limit and use **Clear key** on shared computers.

## AI models must pass a capability check

Settings accepts a model only after a short probe passes: it connects, makes a tool call and returns parseable
JSON. Only verified models appear in the model lists. Embeddings always run locally (ONNX all-MiniLM-L6-v2), in
both apps.

In the browser, each provider must allow cross-origin requests:

- **Azure OpenAI**: add the site's origin to the resource's CORS settings.
- **Ollama**: start it with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` set to the site's origin.
- **Google AI** and the others work from the browser with a normal key; the connect step of the probe reports
  any CORS failure.

## Publishing the browser app

```bash
dotnet publish AIStoryBuildersV2.Web/AIStoryBuildersV2.Web.csproj -c Release -o publish
```

Serve `publish/wwwroot` from any static file server. The server must:

- send `.wasm` as `application/wasm` and `.js`/`.mjs` as `text/javascript`;
- return `index.html` for unknown paths if you want links such as `/story/My%20Story` to survive a reload;
- for a sub-path, set `<base href="/your-path/">` in `index.html`.

On IIS or Windows Azure App Service, deploy the `web.config` and `wwwroot` from the publish folder together. The
`web.config` does all of the above, and has the MIME types IIS lacks for `.onnx` and `.mjs`.

No file is loaded from a CDN: the ONNX runtime, the model and the fonts are in the publish output.
