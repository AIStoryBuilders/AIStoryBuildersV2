# Development environment

How to set up, run and verify AIStoryBuildersV2. It goes with [AIStoryBuildersV2-Plan.md](AIStoryBuildersV2-Plan.md).
This file contains no secrets. Supply keys only through environment variables or the app's Settings page.

## 1. Toolchain

| Item | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | 10.0.19041 or later | The MAUI app's Windows TFM is `net11.0-windows10.0.19041.0` |
| .NET SDK | `11.0.100` | Pinned in `global.json` (plan §6.6) with `rollForward: latestFeature`. The .NET 10 SDKs can stay installed. |
| MAUI workload | `maui-windows 11.0.0/11.0.100` | Installed for SDK 11.0.100 GA (`dotnet workload list`). Before T0 the workloads were managed by Visual Studio 18.11 at preview.6; §2 says how that was fixed. |
| Visual Studio | 18.x with the .NET MAUI workload | Optional for the Web app, practical for MAUI debugging |
| Aspire | `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk 13.6.4`, `Aspire.Hosting.Maui 13.6.4-preview.1.26523.11` | Dev-time only (plan G1). The `aspire` CLI is optional. |
| Node.js | not required | Use any static file server for the published WASM smoke test (§4). `npx serve -s` is one option. |

Check the toolchain:

```bash
dotnet --list-sdks
```

```bash
dotnet workload list
```

## 2. Workloads (T0)

On the development machine this is done: a CLI-managed `maui-windows` workload is installed (§1). On a new machine, use one of these:

1. Open **Visual Studio Installer**, update Visual Studio to a build that includes .NET 11 MAUI, and keep the **.NET MAUI** workload selected.
2. Alternatively, install a CLI-managed workload for the 11.0.100 SDK. Run it from a folder without a `global.json`, or after T0 has pinned 11.0:

   ```bash
   dotnet workload install maui-windows
   ```

3. Record the `dotnet workload list` output in the T0 commit.

Only `maui-windows` is needed by default. The mobile targets are built only with `-p:IncludeMobileTargets=true`.

## 3. Running the apps

| App | Command | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| WASM, without Aspire | `dotnet run --project AIStoryBuildersV2.Web --launch-profile http` | `http://localhost:5022` (`https://localhost:7213` with the `https` profile), from [launchSettings.json](../AIStoryBuildersV2.Web/Properties/launchSettings.json) |
| MAUI, without Aspire | Visual Studio: set the startup project to `AIStoryBuildersV2` and the target to **Windows Machine**. CLI: `dotnet build AIStoryBuildersV2/AIStoryBuildersV2.csproj -f net11.0-windows10.0.19041.0 -t:Run` | A desktop window |
| Both, with Aspire | `aspire run` from the repo root (it reads `aspire.config.json`), or run `AIStoryBuildersV2.AppHost` | Dashboard on the AppHost profile ports. Resources: `aistorybuildersv2-windows` (start it from the dashboard) and `web`. |

Visual Studio may create `AIStoryBuildersV2/AIStoryBuildersV2.csproj.user` to remember the active debug framework (it should be `net11.0-windows10.0.19041.0`). The file is user-local and not in the repo, so don't commit it.

## 4. Publishing and serving the WASM app

```bash
dotnet publish AIStoryBuildersV2.Web -c Release
```

Serve `AIStoryBuildersV2.Web/bin/Release/net11.0/publish/wwwroot` from any static server. The server must:

- fall back to `index.html` for unknown paths
- serve `.wasm` as `application/wasm`, and serve `.onnx` and `.dat` as `application/octet-stream`
- keep the `<base href>` correct when the app runs under a sub-path. Test this once with a sub-path, because D18 depends on it.

## 5. Steps that need a person

An agent can't complete these on its own. Leave them unchecked and report them (AGENTS.md, "How to work").

| Task | Step | What the person does |
|---|---|---|
| T0 | Workload update | §2 |
| T2b | Golden fixtures | Copy `AIStoryBuildersV2.Tests/Fixtures/V1Story/before/` into `Documents\AIStoryBuilders\` on a machine with V1 installed. Do each operation in [Test-Data.md](Test-Data.md) §3 in the V1 UI. Copy each result back to `after-<operation>/` and commit it. **Back up your own V1 stories first**, and remove the fixture story afterwards. |
| T5, T6, T7b, T16 | Live provider checks | Set the §6 variables, or enter a key in Settings |
| T6 | A model that fails the probe | Run Ollama locally with a model that has no tool support, set `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` (§7), and try to verify it |
| T9a, T10a, T18 | V1 coexistence | Open a V2-edited story in V1 and the reverse, and import V2's `.stybld` into V1 |
| T11, T15 | Visual match | Compare with the artboards at 1440 px |
| T12b | Speech-to-text in WebView2 | Try the microphone button in the MAUI app |

## 6. Environment variables (opt-in live tests)

Live tests are skipped unless these are set. Never commit values.

| Variable | Example value | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ASB_LIVE_PROVIDER` | `Anthropic`, `OpenAI`, `AzureOpenAI`, `GoogleAI` or `Ollama` | T7b, T16 integration tests |
| `ASB_LIVE_KEY` | `<api-key>` | same |
| `ASB_LIVE_MODEL` | `<model-id>` (must be one that passes the probe) | same |
| `ASB_LIVE_ENDPOINT` | `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/` or `http://<ollama-host>:11434/` | Azure and Ollama only |

One more variable is not a live test. It rewrites committed test fixtures, so review the diff before committing:

| Variable | Value | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ASB_REGENERATE_FIXTURES` | `1` | Rewrites `Fixtures/V1Story/before/` (`StoryReadTests`), `Fixtures/V1Story/graph` (`GraphTests`) and `Fixtures/embeddings.json` (`EmbeddingTests`). Those tests also write the graph and embeddings files when they are missing. |

PowerShell, for the current session only:

```powershell
$env:ASB_LIVE_PROVIDER = 'Anthropic'; $env:ASB_LIVE_KEY = '<api-key>'; $env:ASB_LIVE_MODEL = '<model-id>'
```

## 7. Provider notes for the browser (WASM)

| Provider | Browser requirement |
|---|---|
| Anthropic | Works directly. The client sends the `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` header. |
| OpenAI | Works directly (Online does this today) |
| Azure OpenAI | The resource must allow the app's origin in CORS **(assumed; verify in T6)** |
| Google AI | The key goes in a header (D8). CORS is verified in T6. |
| Ollama | Start Ollama with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` set to the app's origin, for example `http://localhost:5022` |

## 8. Where data lives during development

| App | Location | How to reset |
|---|---|---|
| MAUI | `Documents\AIStoryBuilders`, **shared with V1** (D4) | Back it up first. Delete only test stories, never the whole folder. |
| MAUI settings | Preferences `asb.llm.*` and SecureStorage `asb.llm.apiKey` | Settings → Clear key |
| WASM | `localStorage` keys `asb2:*` for the dev origin | DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear site data |
