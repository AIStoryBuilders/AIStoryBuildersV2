# AI StoryBuilders V2: UI Behavior Specification

| | |
|---|---|
| Status | Draft for implementation |
| Date | 2026-11-05 |
| Scope | Every control in the redesigned UI ([Design/DESIGN.md](Design/DESIGN.md)), mapped to concrete behavior |
| Source of truth | Layout and colors: the artboards. Fields: DESIGN.md. Behavior: V1. Decisions: [AIStoryBuildersV2-Plan.md](AIStoryBuildersV2-Plan.md) (cited as "Plan §x" or "Dx"). Where they conflict, see [§19](#19-design-vs-v1-conflicts-and-how-they-were-resolved). |
| Audience | A developer or agent implementing `AIStoryBuildersV2.Shared` |

## 0. How to read this spec

### 0.1 String markers

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"text"` with no marker | Exact V1 UI string. Copy it character for character. |
| **(design)** | Exact text from an artboard |
| **(KGB)** | Exact text from KnowledgeGraphBuilder |
| **(plan)** | Text decided in the Plan |
| **(new)** | Invented for V2 by this spec. Anything else marked **(new)** (a rule, a button, a behavior) is also an invention. |

### 0.2 Notation

- **Toast** = `NotificationService.Notify`, written as `Severity · "Summary" / "Detail" · duration`. Example: `Success · "Saved" / "The file was saved successfully." · 4 s`.
- **Confirm** = `DialogService.Confirm(text, title, new ConfirmOptions { OkButtonText = "Yes", CancelButtonText = "No" })`, written as **title** / text. Every V1 confirm uses Yes / No; keep that.
- **KGB choice dialog** = `DialogExtensions.ChooseAsync` ([DialogExtensions.cs](../../../KnowledgeGraphBuilder/KnowledgeGraphBuilder.Shared/Components/Common/DialogExtensions.cs)).
- **Style/icon** = Radzen `ButtonStyle` · Material icon name. `—` means no icon.
- Service calls name the V2 contract from Plan §6. `Svc` = `AIStoryBuildersService`, `Orch` = `OrchestratorMethods`, `Settings` = `IAppSettingsService`, `Persist` = `IStoryPersistence`, `Export` = `IFileExportService`, `Host` = `IHostCapabilities`, `CurKb` = `ICurrentStoryKnowledgeBase.Current`.

### 0.3 Global conventions

| Topic | Rule | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Unexpected exception in any handler | `Error · "Error" / ex.Message · 4 s`, then `LogService.WriteToLog(ex.Message)`. Clear any busy flag. Unless a row says otherwise, this is the "Failure result". | V1 (every component) |
| Service progress events | Library and Workspace subscribe to `Svc.TextEvent` and `Orch.ReadTextEvent` and show `Info · "" / e.Message · e.DisplayLength × 1000 ms`. Unsubscribe on dispose. | [Index.razor:437-461](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Index.razor) |
| File export | Every download calls `Export.SaveAsync(name, stream, contentType)`. `false` (MAUI save dialog cancelled) shows **no** toast **(new)**. The browser always returns `true`. | Plan D19 |
| File pick | `InputFile` in both apps, with `accept` set. Over the size cap: `Error · "Error" / "The file is larger than {N} MB." · 4 s` **(new)**, nothing is read. | Plan D19, §9 |
| Model dropdowns | Every AI model dropdown lists `AppSettings.VerifiedModels` only. Default selection is `AppSettings.Model`, else the first item. With an empty list the dropdown is disabled and shows "No verified models. Verify a model in Settings." **(new)** with a link to `/settings`, and the action that needs a model is disabled. | Plan §5.6, D9 |
| Speech-to-text | `RadzenSpeechToTextButton`, rendered only when `Host.SupportsSpeechToText`. Captured text is **appended** to the bound field. | Plan §5.6, R9 |
| Dialogs | Radzen `DialogService.OpenAsync`, `CloseDialogOnEsc = true`, `ShowClose = true`, except while a dialog is busy, when Esc and the close button are disabled **(new)**. Widths come from V1 where V1 has the dialog. Every dialog has a 16 px radius, a layered shadow around its edges and a lighter mask **(new, Plan Q16)**. | V1, KGB |
| Busy | V1 pattern: an indeterminate `RadzenProgressBar` replaces the dialog or panel content while a service call runs. Buttons that start another call are disabled while busy **(new)**. | V1 |
| Delete | Every Delete asks for confirmation. | Plan §5.6 |
| Renames that cascade | Ask first, then run the cascading V1 method, with the busy bar. | V1, Plan §5.6 |
| Prose rendering | Paragraph text renders as plain text (`white-space: pre-wrap`), never as `MarkupString`. Indenting is CSS (`text-indent`), not `&nbsp;`. **(new)**, replaces V1's `MarkupString` + `AddParagraphIndenting` (imported manuscripts are untrusted, Plan §9). | Plan §9 |

### 0.4 Routes and query parameters

| Route | Page | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Library | D20 |
| `/logs`, `/settings` | Logs, Settings (`/utility` was removed with fine-tuning, D23) | D20 |
| `/story/{title}?tab=<tab>&p=<kbPath>` | Story Workspace. `title` is `Uri.EscapeDataString`. | D20, D29 |

`tab` values: `details`, `timelines`, `locations`, `characters`, `chapters`, `chat` **(new)**, and `kb` (D13). A missing or unknown `tab` means `chapters` (Plan §5.6). Changing tabs updates the URL with `replace: true` **(new)**. `p` is read only when `tab=kb`. `&create=1` (from `KbLinkBuilder.CreateHref`) creates the page instead of opening it (§17.5).

---

## 1. App shell (`MainLayout`)

Layout: [Library.dc.html](Design/Library.dc.html) top bar. Logo, wordmark "AI StoryBuilders" with the subline "Manuscript studio" **(design)**, then the menu.

| Control | Style/icon | Enabled when | Action | Confirm | Success | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home | `RadzenMenuItem` · `home` | always | navigate `/` | — | Item shows the selected state | — |
| Logs | menu · `assignment` | always | navigate `/logs` | — | selected state | — |
| Settings | menu · `line_style` | always | navigate `/settings` | — | selected state | — |

- Icons are V1's ([Index.razor:20-32](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Index.razor)).
- V1 hides Home, Logs and Utility until a key is set. V2 always shows Home, Logs and Settings (Plan §5.6); V1's Utility is removed (D23). **First run:** when `Settings.GetAsync()` returns `ApiKeyConfigured == false` for a provider that needs a key, the first navigation to `/` redirects to `/settings` once per app start (Plan §5.4 "The first run starts at Settings").
- The menu is hidden inside `/story/*`, which has its own top bar ([StoryWorkspace.dc.html](Design/StoryWorkspace.dc.html)).

---

## 2. Library (`/`)

Layout: [Library.dc.html](Design/Library.dc.html), Home view. V1: [Index.razor](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Index.razor).

Header: "Your stories" **(design)**, sub "Start a new manuscript, import a project, or open one you're working on." **(design)**.

| Control | Style/icon | Enabled when | Action | Confirm | Success | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| New Story | Success · `add` | not busy | Open the New Story dialog (§3) | — | §3 | §3 |
| Import Story | Light · `publish` | not busy | `InputFile accept=".stybld"` (§4) | — | §4 | §4 |
| Import docx / pdf / txt **(design)** | Info · `description` | not busy | Open the Import Manuscript dialog (§5) | — | §5 | §5 |
| Story card **Select** | Light · — | not busy | WASM: `await Persist.OpenAsync(title)` first. Then navigate `/story/{EscapeDataString(title)}`. | — | The Workspace opens on the Chapters tab | WASM, zip missing or corrupt: the card shows "Story data is missing from browser storage" **(plan, §7.1)** and a **Remove from library** button. Quota while flushing another story: the quota banner text from §9 as an Error toast, and the selected story does not open (Plan §5.5). |
| Remove from library | Danger · `delete` | only on a card in the missing-data state (WASM) | `Svc.DeleteStoryAsync(title)` | **Remove from library** / "Are you sure?" **(new)** | Reload the list | Global |
| No-model card: Open Settings **(new)** | Primary · `line_style` | shown when `AppSettings.VerifiedModels` is empty | navigate `/settings` | — | — | — |

| Item | Spec |
|---|---|
| Data | `await Svc.GetStorysAsync()` on init and after every action that returns to the Library |
| Card | A book cover colored by the story's Style, with the title's first letter **(new, Plan Q16)**; the title (Newsreader, up to two lines); a Style chip (`"Story"` when empty) and `"Edited {relative time}"` when `StoryIndexEntry.SavedAt` is set **(new)**; and **Select** (Light, `arrow_forward` on the right). Clicking anywhere on the card does the same as **Select** **(new)**. A count line "{n} stories" sits above the grid **(new)**. The design's chapter count is left out, because in WASM it would mean opening every zip (§19). |
| No-model card **(new)** | Shown above the cards when there is no verified model. Text: "Connect an AI provider and verify a model before you create or write stories." **(new)**. New Story stays enabled, but its model dropdown is empty and Create Story is disabled (§0.3). |
| Empty state **(new)** | "No stories yet. Create one with New Story, or import a project.", in a dashed panel with an `auto_stories` icon |
| Loading **(new)** | Four skeleton cards until `GetStorysAsync` returns |
| Busy (creating or importing) | V1: an indeterminate `RadzenProgressBar` at the top. During manuscript import, progress shows inside the Import Manuscript dialog (§5). The action buttons are disabled **(new)**. |
| Keyboard | none |

---

## 3. New Story dialog

V1: [NewStory.razor](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Controls/Story/NewStory.razor) → [StoryEdit.razor:13-39](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Controls/Story/StoryEdit.razor). Layout: Library artboard "NEW STORY dialog". Dialog title "New Story", eyebrow "Create" **(design)**, width 650 px.

| Field | Control | Limits | Default | Validation (on Create Story) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "Story Title:" | `RadzenTextBox`, placeholder "Up to 20 characters" **(design)** | `MaxLength=20` (Plan F2) | empty | Empty: `Error · "Error" / "Story Title is required" · 4 s`. Then `StoryTitle.Validate(title)` (D29); on error: `Error · "Error" / <validator message> · 4 s` (messages in the table below). Then `TrimInnerSpaces`. Duplicate (case-insensitive, through `GetStorysAsync`): `Error · "Error" / "Story name already exists" · 4 s`. |
| Speech-to-text | `RadzenSpeechToTextButton` | — | — | Appends to **Synopsis** (V1 does this although the button sits under the title) |
| "Short Story Synopsis:" | `RadzenTextArea Rows=6`, placeholder "Describe the story in a few sentences..." **(design)** | `MaxLength=1000` | empty | none (V1) |
| "Chapters:" | `RadzenDropDown` `1, 2, 3` | — | `3` | — |
| "AI Model:" | `RadzenDropDown` of verified models | — | the default model | Required; Create Story is disabled without one |

`StoryTitle.Validate` messages **(new)**. Each is shown as the toast detail.

| Rule (D29) | Message |
|---|---|
| Over 100 characters | "Story Title must be 100 characters or fewer." |
| Contains `/ \ : * ? " < > \| #` | "Story Title cannot contain / \ : * ? \" < > \| or #" |
| Contains `..` | "Story Title cannot contain '..'." |
| Leading or trailing space or dot | "Story Title cannot start or end with a space or a dot." |
| Windows reserved name | "'{title}' is a reserved name. Choose another title." |

| Control | Style/icon | Enabled when | Action | Confirm | Success | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create Story | Success · `add` | a model is selected | Validate, then close the dialog with the story. The Library shows the busy bar. Set `story.Theme` to V1's default system message (quote it exactly from [Index.razor:169](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Index.razor)). Then `await Svc.AddStory(story, modelId)`, then `await Svc.EnsureGraphExistsAsync(title)`. | — | Busy off. Navigate `/story/{title}?tab=chapters` (V1 opened the story right away). Progress toasts come from `TextEvent` ("Create the Character files", "Create the Location files", "Create the Timeline file", "Create Chapter {N}") and `ReadTextEvent` ("Calling AI provider..."). | Validation: the dialog stays open with the toast above. Service exception: Global; the Library returns to normal. |
| Close (X) | icon button · `close` | not busy | Close, return nothing | — | — | — |

Keyboard: Esc closes.

---

## 4. Import Story (`.stybld`)

V1: [Index.razor:214-284](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Index.razor). Plan §7.7, D6, D22. There is no dialog; the button opens the file picker.

| Step | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Pick | `InputFile accept=".stybld"`, `OpenReadStream(StoryStorageConstants.MaxStybldImportBytes)` (50 MB) |
| Run | Library busy bar. Keep the title list from before. `var msg = await Svc.ImportProjectAsync(bytes)`. |
| Result toast | V1 shows every message as `Info · "Import Result" / msg · 4 s`. V2 keeps the summary and detail, but uses **Success** when the story list gained a title and **Error** otherwise **(new)**. The messages come from the service unchanged (Plan §6.2): "The project '{Title}' was successfully imported.", "The version of the file you are trying to import is not compatible with this version of AI Story Builders. Please update AI Story Builders to the latest version and try again.", "The story {Title} already exists. Backup and delete it before trying to import a new version.", or the exception message. |
| Graph | For the **new** title (the difference between the lists before and after, not V1's `LastOrDefault()`): `await Svc.EnsureGraphExistsAsync(title)` |
| After | Reload the cards. Stay on the Library (V1). |
| WASM quota (§7.7) | The partial story is removed by the service. `Error · "Browser storage is full" (KGB) / "The story was not imported. Delete stories you don't need, then try again." (new) · sticky` |
| Zip Slip or bad entry | The service rejects the whole file; show its message in the Error toast |

---

## 5. Import Manuscript dialog (`ImportManuscriptDialog`)

V1: [Index.razor:286-362](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Index.razor). V1 has no dialog: a picker, then a progress bar on the Library. V2 puts both in a small dialog **(new)** titled "Import docx / pdf / txt" **(design)**, width 520 px.

| Control | Style/icon | Enabled when | Action | Confirm | Success | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Choose file **(new)** | `InputFile accept=".docx,.pdf,.txt,.md"` | not busy | Read up to 50 MB (`MaxManuscriptImportBytes`). Start right away. Progress starts at 0 with "Starting import..." | — | — | Over the cap: §0.3 |
| (running) | `RadzenProgressBar Value=progress Max=100 ShowValue=true`, then the status text | — | `ManuscriptParsingService.ParseManuscriptAsync(stream, fileName, progress, status)`, then `Svc.PersistImportedStoryAsync(story, Orch)` (V2 builds the graph inside it) | — | Close the dialog and navigate `/story/{title}?tab=chapters` (V1 opened the story) | `Error · "Import Error" / ex.Message · 4 s`. Log `"ImportManuscript: " + ex.Message`. The dialog stays open with the picker reset. A duplicate title throws "A story named '{Title}' already exists. Rename or delete it first." |
| Cancel **(new)** | Light · — | not busy | Close | — | — | — |

| Item | Spec |
|---|---|
| Status texts | From the service, unchanged: "Preparing working directory…", "Extracting text from file…", "Identifying chapter boundaries…", "Parsing chapters — chunk {i} of {n}…", "Creating paragraph structures…", "Chapter {i}/{n}: Generating summary…", "…: Extracting narrative beats…", "…: Identifying characters…", "…: Identifying locations…", "…: Identifying timelines…", "Associating paragraphs with entities…", "Assembling story and generating embeddings…", "Assembling chapter {i}/{n}…", "Import complete!". `TextEvent` toasts also fire ("Writing timelines…" and so on). |
| Indeterminate | When progress is 0, show the indeterminate bar (V1) |
| Busy | Esc, X and Cancel are disabled |

---

## 6. Settings (`/settings`)

Layout: Library artboard Settings view. Header "Settings" **(design)**, sub "Connect an AI provider. Embeddings run locally — no cloud embedding calls needed." **(design)**. The form is KGB's [LlmSettingsForm.razor](../../../KnowledgeGraphBuilder/KnowledgeGraphBuilder.Shared/Components/Settings/LlmSettingsForm.razor) (Plan §5.6, D7), with the probe (Plan §5.9, §7.3). V1: [Settings.razor](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Settings.razor).

### 6.1 Fields

| Field | Control | Shown when | Default | Validation (inline, under the field, `kgb-err` style) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "AI Provider:" | `RadzenDropDown<LlmProvider>`: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Ollama (Fake in DEBUG) | always | saved, else Anthropic (Plan §6.3) | — |
| "API Key:" | `RadzenPassword`, placeholder "Paste the key" **(KGB)**. When a key is saved: badge "Configured" **(KGB)** + **Replace** + **Clear key**. When none: badge "Not set" **(KGB)**. | provider needs a key (`LlmDefaults.RequiresKey`) | empty | Missing on Save: "Enter an API key." **(new)**. OpenAI key that does not start with `sk-`: "Invalid API Key - must start with: sk-" (V1 toast text, shown inline) |
| Endpoint | `RadzenTextBox`, placeholder from KGB (`LlmSettingsForm.razor:58`). Label "Azure OpenAI Endpoint:" for Azure, "Endpoint" **(KGB)** for Ollama. | Azure OpenAI, Ollama (`LlmDefaults.RequiresEndpoint`) | empty | Missing: "Enter the endpoint URL." **(new)**. Not an absolute http(s) URL: "Enter a full URL that starts with https:// or http://." **(new)** |
| Model label | V1 labels: "Azure OpenAI Model Deployment Name:", "Anthropic Model:", "Google AI Model:", otherwise "Default AI Model:" | always | the saved model, or `LlmDefaults.DefaultModel(provider)` | Empty: "Pick or type a model name." **(new)** |
| Model | KGB: a filterable dropdown when the list loaded, otherwise a text box. The link "Type a name instead" / "Pick from the list" **(KGB)** switches. Help line: "{n} models available." / "{n} deployments available." / "Loading models…" / "{status} Type the name instead." **(KGB)** | always | — | — |
| Ollama CORS note | Help text **(KGB)**: "The Ollama host must allow this page's origin: set OLLAMA_ORIGINS on the machine running Ollama." | Ollama and `Host.IsBrowser` | — | — |
| Key storage note | KGB help text, browser version or MAUI version, quoted exactly from `LlmSettingsForm.razor:86-93` (it names `LlmDefaults.HostFor`) | key field shown | — | — |
| Embeddings note | "Embeddings are handled locally (no cloud embedding calls needed)." (V1, small text) | always | — | — |
| Privacy note | KGB callout **(KGB)**: "Page text the assistant reads is sent to the selected provider. Ollama keeps everything on the machine that runs it." | always | — | — |

Removed: V1's Azure **Api Version** (Plan D8) and Organization (D31).

### 6.2 Controls

| Control | Style/icon | Enabled when | Action | Confirm | Success | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Get an API key | Secondary · — . Text per provider, from V1: "An OpenAI API Key is required (Click here to get one)", "An Azure OpenAI API Key is required (Click here to get one)", "An Anthropic API Key is required (Click here to get one)", "A Google AI API Key is required (Click here to get one)" | shown when the provider needs a key and none is saved or typed (Plan §5.6, Q9) | `JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync("open", "<provider console URL>")` (a constant per provider; MAUI opens the system browser) | — | — | — |
| Refresh models | Light (KGB: Text/Base) · `refresh`, title "Refresh models from API" (V1), `IsBusy` while loading | not loading | `Settings.ListModelsAsync(provider, endpoint, newKey, refresh: true)`. Typing the key or endpoint reloads it after 750 ms (KGB). | — | `Success · "Models Refreshed" / "Found {n} available models." · 3 s` (V1) | No key typed or saved: `Warning · "API Key Required" / "Enter an API key first to fetch available models." · 3 s` (V1). Error: `Error · "Refresh Failed" / "Could not fetch models: {message}" · 4 s` (V1), and the list empties so the text box shows. |
| Replace | Light (KGB: Outlined Base) · — | key configured | Shows the key input; **Cancel** **(KGB)** hides it again | — | — | — |
| Clear key | Danger (Text) · — | key configured | `Settings.ClearApiKeyAsync()` | — (KGB has none) | `Info · "API key cleared" · 3 s` **(KGB)**. Reload the model list. | Global |
| Test connection | Light (KGB: Outlined Base) · `network_check`, `BusyText="Testing…"` **(KGB)** | not busy | If dirty, run **Save** first and stop on failure. Then `Settings.TestConnectionAsync(30 s)`. | — | Callout (success): "Connected to {Provider} ({model})." **(KGB)** | Callout (danger) with the returned message |
| Save | Primary · `save`, `IsBusy`, `BusyText="Verifying model…"` **(new)** | dirty (KGB `Dirty`) and inline validation passes | `var r = await Settings.SaveAsync(provider, model, endpoint, newKey, ct)`. The service probes when `model` is not verified for this provider and host (Plan §5.9): Connect, then A (tool call), then B (graph parse). | — | `Success · "Settings saved" · 3 s` **(KGB)**. If a probe ran, also `Success · "Model verified" / "{model} passed the capability check." · 4 s` **(new)**. Clear the key box, reload the model list, raise `Changed` so other dropdowns refresh. | `r.Saved == false` with a probe: danger callout "{model} did not pass the {stage} check: {r.Probe.Message} Nothing was saved." **(new)**. Stage names **(new)**: Connect = "connection", ToolCall = "tool call", GraphParse = "knowledge graph". Other error: callout with `r.Error`. WASM quota: callout "Browser storage is full, so the settings weren't saved. Export stories you don't need with Export Project, then delete them from the Library." **(new; KGB points to its own backup)** |

Behavior notes:

- Changing the provider sets the model to the saved one (if it is the saved provider) or `LlmDefaults.DefaultModel` and reloads the list (KGB `OnProviderChanged`).
- Changing provider or endpoint host filters the verified list on Save; changing only the key keeps it (Plan §5.9).
- After the first successful Save, a user who arrived through the first-run redirect is sent to `/` **(new)**, as V1's `SettingsChanged` returned to Home.

### 6.3 Verified models panel (`VerifiedModelsPanel`, new in V2)

Plan §5.6, §5.9, D9, D23. Title "Verified models" **(plan)**. Sub "Only these models can be used for writing and chat. A model is added after it calls a tool and reads a small knowledge graph correctly." **(new)**.

| Control | Style/icon | Enabled when | Action | Confirm | Success | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Row: model name (mono), "Verified {date}" **(new)**, badge "Default" **(new)** on the default model | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Remove | Danger (Text) · `delete` | not the default model. The default row's button is disabled with the tooltip "This is the default model. Pick another default first." **(new)** | `Settings.RemoveVerifiedModelAsync(model)` | **Remove model** / "Remove {model} from the verified models? It will have to pass the check again before it can be used." **(new)** | Row removed; `Changed` refreshes the dropdowns | Global |
| Model to add **(new)** | Filterable dropdown over the provider's model list, or a text box (same switch as §6.1) | settings saved (key and endpoint present) | — | — | — | — |
| Add model | Success · `add`, `BusyText="Verifying…"` **(new)** | a name is entered, it is not already verified, nothing is busy | `Settings.VerifyModelAsync(model)` (uses the saved provider, endpoint and key) | — | Row added. `Success · "Model verified" / "{model} passed the capability check." · 4 s` **(new)** | Danger callout under the panel: "{model} did not pass the {stage} check: {message}" **(new)** |

| State | Text |
|---|---|
| Empty **(new)** | "No verified models yet. Save your settings, or add a model, to run the capability check." |
| Loading | Skeleton rows (KGB `kgb-sk`) |

The list is `AppSettings.VerifiedModels` (already filtered to this provider and host, Plan §6.3).

### 6.4 Storage usage panel (WASM only, `StorageUsagePanel`)

Plan §5.5 step 7.

| Item | Spec |
|---|---|
| Meter | `RadzenProgressBar Value=EstimatedBytes Max=AssumedQuotaBytes`. Label "Browser storage: {used} of about 5 MB ({pct}%) · {n} stories" **(new)** |
| Warning at 80% or more | Warning callout: "Browser storage is almost full. Export the stories you want to keep, and delete the ones you don't need." **(new)** |
| Hidden | When `Persist.GetUsageAsync()` returns null (MAUI) |
| Embedding self-test (DEBUG only) | Light · `science`, text "Embedding self-test" **(plan, §10)**. Embeds the 5 fixture sentences and lists the cosine against `Fixtures/embeddings.json`. A pass is ≥ 0.98. |

Keyboard (Settings page): Enter in a text field does not submit **(new)**.

---

## 7. Logs (`/logs`)

V1: [Logs.razor](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Logs.razor). Layout: Library artboard Logs view. Header "Logs" **(design)**, sub "Activity and error log for this installation." **(design)**.

| Control | Style/icon | Enabled when | Action | Confirm | Success | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Export Log | Primary · `save_alt` | log not empty | Build V1's HTML table (one `<tr><td>` per line), **HTML-encoding each line** **(new)**. `Export.SaveAsync("AIStoryBuildersLog_{yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss}.html", …, "text/html")`. | — | `Success · "Saved" / "The file was saved successfully." · 4 s`. V1's variant names the file path, which V2's `IFileExportService` does not return. | Global |
| Clear Log | Danger · `delete` | always | `IAppDataStore.WriteAsync(AppDataFile.Log, "Log cleared on " + DateTime.Now)` (V1 text), then reload | **Clear Log** / "Are you sure?" **(new)** (V1 clears without asking) | `Success · "Success" / "Log Cleared" · 4 s` | Global. WASM quota: Error toast summary "Browser storage is full" **(KGB)** |

| Item | Spec |
|---|---|
| Data | `IAppDataStore.ReadAsync(AppDataFile.Log)`, split on `\n`, drop a trailing empty line. Newest first, at most 1,001 lines (V1 format). |
| Grid | `RadzenDataGrid`, columns **Date** and **Entry** **(design)**, paging 20 per page **(new)**, `ShowPagingSummary`. |
| Date column **(new)** | V1 lines have no date. V2's `LogService.WriteToLog` writes `"{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} {text}"` (invariant culture, still one text line, so V1 can read it). The grid shows the leading timestamp in **Date** when a line matches `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2} `, and "—" otherwise. |
| Empty **(new)** | "The log is empty." |
| Loading | Indeterminate bar |

---

## 8. Utility (removed)

V1's Utility page (Fine Tuning, Create Training Data, JsonL Utility, Edit Model Name) is **removed** in V2: fine-tuning is no longer supported (Plan D23, superseded 2026-11-05). There is no `/utility` route and no menu item.

---

## 9. Story Workspace shell (`/story/{title}`)

Layout: [StoryWorkspace.dc.html](Design/StoryWorkspace.dc.html) top bar and tab strip. V1: [StoryControl.razor](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Controls/Story/StoryControl.razor). Plan §5.5, §5.6, §5.7, D13, D20.

### 9.1 Open and close

| Step | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Enter | `Persist.OpenAsync(title)` (WASM extracts the zip; MAUI no-op). Then `var kb = await IStoryKnowledgeBaseProvider.OpenAsync(title)` and set `ICurrentStoryKnowledgeBase.Current = kb` (D13). Load the story with `GetStorysAsync()` and match the title, ignoring case. Subscribe to `Persist.Changed`, `Svc.TextEvent` and `Orch.ReadTextEvent`. |

V1 [ParagraphEdit.razor:284-472](../../../ADefWebserver/AIStoryBuilders/Components/Pages/Controls/Paragraphs/ParagraphEdit.razor), Plan §5.6. Runs inside the Save busy state, before `UpdateParagraph`.

| Step | Behavior |

| 4 | Existing characters: `Success · "Info" / "Detecting attributes on existing characters…" · 2 s`, then `Svc.SimplifyCharacter(existing, paragraph)` and `Orch.DetectCharacterAttributes(paragraph, simplified, "Existing Character")` |
| 5 | Any results: open the **Select Character Attributes** dialog (V1 title, 500 × 360 px). A `RadzenTree` with checkboxes over `CharacterDisplay`, all expanded, and the button "Add Characters and Attributes" (Primary). Closing with X adds nothing. |
| 6 | For the checked values (`Name\|Action\|Type\|Text`): add new characters to the paragraph and the story list; add attributes to existing characters; `await Svc.AddUpdateCharacterAsync(c, c.CharacterName)` for each character in the paragraph (V1) |

| Streaming | A provisional AI bubble showing "Thinking..." until the first chunk |
| Graph loading | On tab activation (§9.4). Send is disabled meanwhile; show "Loading the story graph…" **(new)** under the header. |
| Empty | "No messages yet. Ask a question about your story!" and, smaller, the V1 examples line: "Examples: "Are there any orphaned characters?", "Tell me about the main characters"" |
| Service messages | Shown as AI bubbles exactly as yielded, for example the `GetClientAsync` reasons "Add an API key in Settings" and "Model '<m>' has not passed the capability check. Verify it in Settings." **(plan)** |
| Graph mutations | V1 behavior: mutation tools run first with `confirmed=false`, the model shows the preview and asks; the change runs only after the user agrees in chat (T13). There is no separate dialog. After a confirmed mutation the entity tabs reload when next activated (§9.4). |
| History | Kept while the workspace is open; cleared on Close workspace (§9.1) |
| Keyboard | Enter sends, Shift+Enter newline |

## 17. Knowledgebase tab (`KnowledgeBaseTab`)

Layout: workspace artboard KNOWLEDGEBASE. Code: KGB [ExplorerPane.razor](../../../KnowledgeGraphBuilder/KnowledgeGraphBuilder.Shared/Components/Explorer/ExplorerPane.razor), [EditorPane.razor](../../../KnowledgeGraphBuilder/KnowledgeGraphBuilder.Shared/Components/Editor/EditorPane.razor), [LinksPanel.razor](../../../KnowledgeGraphBuilder/KnowledgeGraphBuilder.Shared/Components/Editor/LinksPanel.razor), [GraphPage.razor](../../../KnowledgeGraphBuilder/KnowledgeGraphBuilder.Shared/Pages/GraphPage.razor) (as `KnowledgeGraphView`), [Common/](../../../KnowledgeGraphBuilder/KnowledgeGraphBuilder.Shared/Components/Common/DialogExtensions.cs) dialogs, routed as in [WorkspacePage.razor](../../../KnowledgeGraphBuilder/KnowledgeGraphBuilder.Shared/Pages/WorkspacePage.razor). Plan §5.6 Knowledgebase row, §5.7, D11–D13.

Every KGB component reads `CurKb.Workspace`, `CurKb.Graph`, `CurKb.State` and `CurKb.Links` instead of injected singletons (D13). Every link uses `CurKb.Links.PageHref` or `CreateHref`. All KB writes mark the story dirty (§5.7). KGB's chat, tour and help are not ported.

### 17.1 Bar

| Out of view | "This page isn't in the current view. Use Show around to see its links." / "No links in this view." **(KGB)** |

JS bindings return a handle that `DisposeAsync` releases (Plan §5.7).

### 17.7 KB error toasts (`PageCommands.ShowError`, sticky)

| Exception | Summary **(KGB)** | Detail |
|---|---|---|

## 19. Design-vs-V1 conflicts and how they were resolved

| # | Conflict | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The Settings artboard has no Azure endpoint, Clear key or Test connection | Plan §5.6 and Q8: KGB `LlmSettingsForm` fields plus the probe; the artboard gives layout only |
| 2 | The Utility artboard shows only the fine-tune list; V1 has three tabs | Utility removed (D23, superseded) |
| 3 | V1's Utility note "FineTuning in Azure OpenAI is not supported." is shown for every non-OpenAI provider | Moot: Utility removed (D23) |
| 4 | The artboard's character background types (Personality, Backstory, Relationships) differ from V1's | V1 types (Appearance, Goals, History, Aliases, Facts): they are stored in the files and used by `DetectCharacterAttributes` |
| 5 | The artboard lists all background types at once; V1 filters by the dropdown | Artboard: list everything, with the type in the heading; the dropdown only sets the type for **Add Background** |
| 6 | The timeline dialog artboard lacks V1's Description and shows date-times | Keep Description (it is in `Timelines.csv`); use `ShowTime=true` and the artboard labels "Start Date:" and "Stop Date:" |
| 7 | Entity dialogs in the artboard always show Delete | V1: Delete only for saved items. New dialogs are titled "New …" (Plan §5.6). |
| 8 | The artboard's AI dialog button says "Save" | "Generate" (Plan §5.6) |
| 9 | The artboard selectors have Cancel and Save; V1 has one Close that applies the choice | Artboard buttons; Save applies to the in-popup copy, Cancel discards |
| 10 | The artboard's chapter tools icon is labeled "Add chapter" | Plan §5.6: `note_add` = insert before, tooltip "Insert chapter before" |
| 11 | The artboard always shows chapter Delete | V1: hidden when there is only one chapter |
| 12 | The artboard shows chapter titles ("Chapter One", "A collection of sounds"); V1 chapters have only a name and a synopsis | Eyebrow = V1 `ChapterName`; title = first sentence of the synopsis **(new)** |
| 13 | The artboard shows chapter counts and edit times on story cards; V1 shows titles only | Style plus edit time; no chapter count, so WASM does not open every zip |
| 14 | The artboard's Logs grid has a Date column; V1 log lines have no date | V2 writes a timestamp prefix that V1 can still read **(new)** |
| 15 | V1 keeps a blank editable paragraph at the end of every chapter; the design has only "Add first paragraph" | Added "Add section" at the end of a non-empty chapter **(new)** |
| 16 | V1 Character Save writes first and asks about the rename afterwards | Ask first; No saves nothing **(new order)** |
| 17 | V1 deletes a character background and clears the log without asking | Confirm both (Plan §5.6 "Every Delete asks") |
| 18 | V1 toasts "Calling ChatGPT to detect Attributes..." | Provider-neutral text **(new)** |
| 19 | The artboard's graph legend is Characters / Locations / Timelines | Plan §5.6: color by top-level folder (KGB); the artboard shows sample folders |
| 20 | KGB "Show in graph" and graph links use KGB routes (`graph?p=`, `./?p=`) | D13 and D20: `KbLinkBuilder` links; the Pages/Graph toggle is component state |
| 21 | The Manuscript Editor artboard has its own top bar with Preview and Display settings | Not built; the workspace top bar is used (Q6) |
| 22 | V1 renders prose as `MarkupString` | Plain text with CSS indenting (Plan §9) |
| 23 | V1's Import Story toast is always Info | Success or Error, depending on whether a story was added **(new)** |
